# How to download from Videasy (and similar Sites)
You cannot directly input a player link like https://player.videasy.net/movie/1234821, as this doesnt directly lead to the video file.

So, you need to get the Link to the .m3u8 file.



## Using my Browser Extension 
I made an Browser Extension to automatically detect .m3u8 File Links, you can install it [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/m3u8-link-finder/).
<br><br/>
(For the best Experience Pin the Extension to your Toolbar)
<br><br/>
Just install the Extension and start playing the Movie you want to download, then wait until a "New" Badge <img width="31" height="35" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/786212cc-6003-4eb7-9d4d-21a42f0f7db0" />

or a Notification 

<img width="596" height="181" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/691f2851-f985-44b4-985c-c8fbe9ef0471" />

appears.

Now, open the Extension UI and press the copy to clipboard Button.
<br><br/>
Congrats! You can now use this Link to download your Movie : )

## The manual way

If the Extension doesnt work for you, or you dont want to install it, use [this Guide](https://github.com/truelockmc/video-downloader/blob/main/videasy_2.md)
